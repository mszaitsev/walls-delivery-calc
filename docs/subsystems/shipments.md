# Shipments

Version: 0.122.0

Shipment code lives under `src/Shipments` and `src/Carriers/*/Shipment*` where carrier APIs require it.

Carrier-specific shipment implementations currently exist for CDEK, DPD, Russian Post, and Yandex Delivery. Shared behavior is documented in [shipment-framework.md](../architecture/shipment-framework.md). Use that document and [new-carrier-guide.md](../development/new-carrier-guide.md) before changing carrier shipment code.
